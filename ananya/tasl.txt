TASK 2:
Q): drop the ans to the following queestions
a-how git overflow works?
ans - git overflow is basically a procedure in which file undergoes three stages:
1.here the git clone command will create a locker repository in workspace .
2.add - it is to add a file from the workspace to the index after that the file is staged.
and to commit the file all the file staged their changes will be comitted to the locker repository.
3. there is a local repository from where we have to push our changes to remote repository.
at remote repository it is visible to anyone who uses this repository .

b - what are the different stages of a git project as commit, add?
there are three stages they are as follows:
ans -clone - creates a local repository in workspace.
add - adds a file to the index.
commit - is like save after you have made changes to your file.
and push is included in the third stage only
push - basically pushes your changes from local to remote.

c - is it possible to do a git commit before git add . if you have made any changes explain why?
ans - no it is not possible to do a git commit before git add because you havr to first explicitly
specify the changes or modifications that you have done rather than just going to the next step commit
as first the files will be staged and then comitted this will be for new files.

d - why is git diff used?
ans - it is used to find difference between files in workspace and index stage and what you could still 
for furthur to commit and that then the local changes will not make it to the next commit.and this we can
use as a sanity check before doing a commit to make sure all the local changes that you have and you want to 
commit are already staged.

e - can we leave a commit message as blank?
ans - yes we can leave the commit message empty it is not necessary to add a message to the commit box,
until and unless you want a specific message to be given or specified there.
