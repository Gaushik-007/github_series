### A branch is like a another version of code that we may want to add in master or not later but we woRk on it at present. its a diversion from master

## c. What is a PR? 

### pull request is when i want to push a code to a repo for which i dont have access to so i will have to pull a request .

## d. Can we delete the master branch if not Why? 

### if we try to delete a remote master , it instead deletes a local master branch . To achieve that we can  run git push origin :master. Essentially what we're doing here is pushing a null branch (the empty branch name to the left of the :) over top of the remote branch (the branch name to the right-side of the :), effectively deleting it. 

## e. How can we delete a branch? (Explore a bit about this yourself)

### git branch -d branchname deletes both locally and remotely.
